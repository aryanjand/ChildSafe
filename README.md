# DNSGuard

DNSGuard is a mobile application designed to enhance internet security and privacy by allowing users to easily switch between different DNS servers provided by Cloudflare. The app provides options to use DNS servers for general use, malware protection, and adult content filtering. Future features will include encryption for DNS queries to further protect user privacy.

## Features

- Switch between Cloudflare DNS servers:
  - `1.1.1.1` (General purpose DNS)
  - `1.1.1.2` (DNS with malware protection)
  - `1.1.1.3` (DNS with malware and adult content filtering)
- User-friendly interface for easy DNS configuration
- Future updates to include DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) for encrypted DNS queries

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
